  <review>I am one of those rare bay area natives that actually likes LA (your weather and beaches kick our asses), but one thing we def do better in SF is fine dining. &#xA0;If this place were in San Francisco, I bet it'd net about 3 to 3.5 stars.&#xD;
&#xD;
Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not 4.5 stars with almost 1000 reviews good. &#xA0;I ordered a la carte and the stand out dishes were the foie gras ravioli, the bread, and the dessert. &#xA0;I was somewhat underwhelmed by my entree as well as the bite of my dinnermate's entree (the John Dory). &#xA0;I realize I just said that approx 80% of my dinner was great, but when the entree is just kinda okay, it kinda dampens the meal. &#xA0;There wasn't anything special about the bass, it wasn't terrible but it also wasn't terribly good. &#xA0;&#xD;
&#xD;
The service wasn't that hot either. &#xA0;I think it's a two way tie between SF and LA for world's douchiest service in restaurants. &#xA0;Everyone seemed to be on auto-pilot and it took forever to get our check. &#xA0;Also, the hostess kept coming and going to the area behind our table, which happened to be the emergency exit, and squatting down and fiddling with something. &#xA0;It was distracting as hell. &#xA0;&#xD;
&#xD;
LA-your casual dining scene is phenomenal (hello Pizzeria Mozza), but your fine dining still has a ways to go.</review>
